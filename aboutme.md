subtitle: An Engineer Who Builds Software For EVs
---

I'm a senior controls engineer for a company that converts gasoline powered vehicles to electric vehicles. My software has been driven over 4.5 million miles.

My main responsibilities include building software and diagnosing issues for: 
- DC Charging
- AC Charging
- Vehicle Diagnostics

I aim to create vehicle software that is simple, easy to read, and safe to operate. 

When I'm not at work, I can be found hanging out with my dog, Teddy.
