subtitle: An Engineer Who Builds Software For EVs
---

Currently, I'm a senior controls engineer developing software for electric vehicle conversions. My software has been driven over 4.8 million miles on vehicles across North America. 

I specialize in: 
- DC Charging
- AC Charging
- Vehicle Diagnostics

I aim to create vehicle software that is simple, easy to read, and safe to operate. I love teaching people about how EV charging works in order to increase the overall understanding of charging. 

When I'm not at work, I can be found hanging out with my dog, Teddy.
